# Mental Health Predictor

## Selected Topic
- Predicting mental health severity in United States based on variety of socioeconomic and enviornmental factors including, but not limited to:
  - populaton density
  - annual income
  - water and land features
## Reason for Selecting Topic
- Building a model that can predict mental health risk for an individual
- The prediction can provide awareness needed to address mental health concerns
## Description of Data Sources
- 500 Cities: Local Data for Better Health, 2019---[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Division of Population Health, Epidemiology and Surveillance Branch](https://chronicdata.cdc.gov/500-Cities-Places/500-Cities-Local-Data-for-Better-Health-2019-relea/6vp6-wxuq)

## Questions Hoping to Answer
- What are the most and least significant factors in predicting mental health severity?
## Communication Protocols
- Keeping updated on the status of each of our parts in the project and general project status, each team member regularly communicates through Slack messaging and Zoom meetings.

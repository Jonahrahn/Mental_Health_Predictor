# Mental Health Predictor

## Selected Topic
- Predicting prevalence of poor mental health in United States based on various socioeconomic and enviornmental factors including, but not limited to:
  - populaton density
  - annual household income
  - water and land features
## Reason for Selecting Topic
- Building a model that can predict mental health risk for an individual
- The prediction can provide awareness needed to address mental health concerns
